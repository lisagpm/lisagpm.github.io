        <ul>
            <li><h1>Labrador Retriever</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/labrador.png" alt="Labrador">
                <p>On September 11, 2001, Michael Hingson, along with his guide dog for the blind, Roselle, was working as usual on the 78th floor in Tower One of the World Trade Center. When the planes struck, Roselle guided him through the building and down the stairwell—1,463 steps—to safety. The yellow Labrador Retriever led Hingson through the choking smoke and chaos, and away from the building just before it collapsed.</p> 
            <li><h1>German Shepherd</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/german%20shepherd.png" alt="German Shepherd">
                <p>Named one of history’s most heroic animals by Time Magazine, Trakr was a German Shepherd Dog who, along with his handler, dug through the debris at the World Trade Center and located the last survivor of the 9/11 attack.</p><br>
            <li><h1>Vizsla</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/Vizsla.png" alt="Vizsla">
                <p>We all know how reliable a dog’s sense of smell is, and dogs are often used to detect bombs and drugs. But Duke, the Vizsla. is trained to sniff out peanuts, in any form and often in minute quantities, such as in oil, dust, or butter. Duke alerts his owner to the presence of peanuts by sitting firmly in front of her, blocking her from the offending allergen, and refusing to budge. His owner says that Duke saves her life every day.</p>

        <h2>Working Dogs</h2>
        <img src= "images/snoopy-worker.png" alt="work image" class="desktop">
        
        <ul>
            <li><h1>Bernese Mountain Dog</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/bernese3.png" alt="Bernese">
                <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog was built for hard work. They were bred to drive cattle, guard farmyards from predators, and were revered for their ability to pull many times their own weight.</p><br>  
            <li><h1>Doberman Pinscher</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/Doberman.png" alt="Doberman">
                <p>One of the world’s finest protection dogs is, no doubt, the Doberman Pinscher. With their magnificent physique and keen intelligence, these canines originated in 19th-century Germany and were tailored for police and military work. Dobermans in modern day continue to excel in K-9 duty and as therapy dogs, service dogs, and search and rescue dogs. </p><br>
            <li><h1>Komondor</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/Komondor.png" alt="Komondor">
                <p>Covered in profuse white cords from head to tail, this powerfully large Hungarian flock guardian is certainly hard to miss. For centuries, the Komondor has been guarding sheep at pasture, being confident and tough enough to run off wolves and other animals. The breed’s infamous dreadlocks provide protection from extreme weather and sharp-toothed predators, but also help them blend in with their flocks, creating an element of surprise.</p>

        <h2>Companion Dogs</h2>
        <img src= "images/snoopy-companion.png" alt="companion image" class="desktop">
        
        <ul>
            <li><h1>Beagle</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/Beagle.png" alt="Beagle">
                <p>Kevin Weaver has diabetes. He also has a specially-trained beagle named Belle who can sense when his blood sugar levels are off. She licks his nose, and then paws at him to signal that he should take a reading. In the summer of 2006, Belle put another skill to work. Weaver suffered a seizure and collapsed. Belle grabbed the man's cell phone and bit down on the number 9, just like she had been trained. The number was programmed to dial 911, and emergency workers soon arrived. Belle was later given an award for those who use cell phones to save lives. Belle was the first dog to ever win the award.</p><br>  
            <li><h1>Akita</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/Akita.png" alt="Akita">
                <p>When a shooter killed 27 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the children were obviously traumatized. Samantha Kuric, in particular, had a hard time even leaving the house in the aftermath of the tragedy. But then when her mother brought her to a school for comfort and therapy dogs, Sammy met Spartacus, an Akita, and they bonded immediately.  After just a couple of hours together, Sammy seemed worlds better. The dog’s handler, Brad, asked if he could take him to help some other people. Samantha agreed—but Spartacus didn’t want to leave her! In the years since, Spartacus has gone on to help a number of other trauma victims, but he and Sammy have retained their bond and remain good friends. He’s made her feel safe in troubling times and helped to heal her emotional scars over time in a way that would have been much more difficult without him. Spartacus’ impact, as well as that of other therapy dogs after the tragedy, inspired a Connecticut state law requiring that all crisis victims be given access to certified dogs within 24 hours of a tragedy.</p><br>
            <li><h1>Great Dane</h1></li>
            <img class="dogs" src="images/Great%20Dane.png" alt="Great Dane">
                <p>George comes from the Service Dog Project, which trains dogs to help the mobility impaired. The Great Dane was paired with Bella, a 10-year-old girl with a rare genetic disorder called Morquio Syndrome. This disorder makes mobility exceptionally difficult and requires Bella to undergo many operations. Before she met George, Bella used a wheelchair or crutches to move around, but George has given Bella the strength and determination to walk and take part in activities she otherwise would not have been able to do. George and Bella have an inseparable bond and he will do anything for her. He has helped her gain confidence, independence and happiness.</p>
